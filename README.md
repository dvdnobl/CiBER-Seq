# CiBER-Seq
Code to explore a powerful data analysis for finding guides which induce significant differential expression in CiBER-Seq.

 - Data from the CiBER-Seq screen is put in the "data" directory. 

 - Metadata for the data from the CiBER-Seq screen needed for DESeq2 analysis is put in the "meta" directory. 

 - Plots generated from EDA, QC, and DESeq2 are put in the "plots" directory.

 - Code for EDA, QC, and running DESeq2 is saved as the "DESeq2_his4.R" file.
